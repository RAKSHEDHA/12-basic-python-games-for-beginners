# Detailed Explanation of 2048 Game (Doraemon Polaroid Version)

This document explains the Python code for the 2048 game with a Doraemon-themed design, which includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and image handling with PIL (Python Imaging Library).

## 1. Installation Instructions

Before running the game, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

### 1.1. Install Python
You need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

### 1.2. Install Required Libraries

Use pip to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pillow
pip install tk
```

- `Pillow` is used for image handling (to display images on tiles).
- `Tkinter` is the built-in library for GUI applications.

### 1.3. Set Up the Images

You will need images to represent the different tile values in the 2048 game. The game requires images for the following tile values: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048.

Place your image files in the directory `D:/images/`, or modify the `TILE_IMAGES` dictionary in the code to point to the correct path where you store your images.

## 2. Code Overview

The game is based on the 2048 puzzle, where you combine tiles with the same value by swiping in one of four directions (up, down, left, right). The goal is to reach the tile with the value of 2048.

### 2.1. Constants and Configuration
At the beginning of the code, the following constants are defined:

```python
SIZE = 4  # Board size (4x4 grid)
TARGET = 2048  # Target value to win the game
TILE_SIZE = 110  # Size of each tile on the game board
TILE_PADDING = 20  # Padding between tiles
WINDOW_PADDING = 20  # Padding around the window
```

These constants define the dimensions of the game board, the size of each tile, and the padding used for positioning the tiles and window.

### 2.2. Tile Images Dictionary
```python
TILE_IMAGES = {
    2: "D:/images/d.jpg",
    4: "D:/images/sh.jpeg",
    8: "D:/images/s.webp",
    16: "D:/images/n.jpeg",
    32: "D:/images/g.jpeg",
    64: "D:/images/do.jpg",
    128: "D:/images/di.jpeg",
    256: "D:/images/nm.jpg",
    512: "D:/images/nd.jpg",
    1024: "D:/images/jk.jpg",
    2048: "D:/images/t.jpg"
}
```

This dictionary maps each tile value to its corresponding image path. You must provide images for each value that appears on the board. The images will be displayed on the respective tiles.

### 2.3. `init_board()` Function
This function initializes the game board as a 4x4 grid filled with zeros (representing empty spaces). It then adds two random tiles (either 2 or 4) to the board.

### 2.4. `add_random_tile(board)` Function
This function selects a random empty space on the board and assigns a tile value of either 2 or 4.

### 2.5. `is_game_over(board)` Function
This function checks whether the game is over by evaluating two conditions:
1. No empty spaces are left on the board.
2. There are no adjacent tiles that can be merged.

If either condition is true, the game is over.

### 2.6. `merge_tiles(tiles)` Function
This function handles the merging of adjacent tiles that have the same value. It iterates through the list of tiles and merges them accordingly, ensuring that only tiles with the same value merge.

### 2.7. `move(board, direction)` Function
This function handles the logic of moving the tiles on the board in one of four directions: "up", "down", "left", or "right". Depending on the direction, it:
- Collects all non-zero tiles in the specified direction.
- Merges the tiles.
- Updates the board with the merged values.
- Adds a random tile after each move.

### 2.8. `Game2048` Class
The main class that controls the game, including the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It handles the display, user input, game logic, and interaction with the board.

#### 2.8.1. `__init__(self, master)`
The constructor initializes the game window, the start screen, and the game frame. It also loads the Doraemon logo and prepares the UI elements (e.g., buttons, labels).

#### 2.8.2. `start_game(self)`
This function hides the start screen and shows the game screen, initializing the board and setting the score to 0.

#### 2.8.3. `update_score(self)`
This function calculates the total score by summing the values of all the tiles on the board. It updates the score label to reflect the current score.

#### 2.8.4. `update_board(self)`
This function redraws the game board by iterating over each tile. It creates rectangles for empty tiles and places images for non-zero tiles. It also updates the score.

#### 2.8.5. `handle_key(self, event)`
This function handles keyboard input for tile movement (up, down, left, right). When a key is pressed, it moves the tiles accordingly, adds a random tile, and updates the board.

### 2.9. `main()` Function
This is the entry point of the program. It creates a Tkinter root window and initializes the `Game2048` class to start the game.

## 3. How to Play the Game

1. **Start the Game:**
   - Upon opening the application, you will see the Doraemon logo along with the title and a "New Game" button.
   - Click on "New Game" to start playing.

2. **Game Controls:**
   - Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the desired direction:
     - **Up**: Move all tiles up.
     - **Down**: Move all tiles down.
     - **Left**: Move all tiles left.
     - **Right**: Move all tiles right.

3. **Game Rules:**
   - Tiles with the same value will merge when they collide.
   - After each move, a random tile (2 or 4) will appear on the board in an empty space.
   - The game ends when the board is full and no moves are possible, or when you reach the target value of 2048.

4. **Winning and Losing:**
   - The game is won when a tile with the value of 2048 is created.
   - If no more moves are possible, the game ends in a loss.

## 4. Example of Running the Game

1. Open the Python file in your editor.
2. Make sure to have the necessary images in the specified path or update the `TILE_IMAGES` dictionary.
3. Run the script, and the Tkinter window will open with the Doraemon-themed 2048 game.

## 5. Conclusion

This code creates a visually appealing version of the classic 2048 game with a Doraemon theme. It uses Tkinter for the GUI and PIL for image handling. The game logic follows the standard rules of 2048, with added functionality for movement, merging tiles, and displaying images for the tiles.

Enjoy playing the game and have fun reaching the 2048 tile!
